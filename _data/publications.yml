    abstract: "Limited accessibility to neurological care leads to underdiagnosed Parkinson's Disease (PD), preventing early intervention. Existing AI-based PD detection methods primarily focus on unimodal analysis of motor or speech tasks, overlooking the multifaceted nature of the disease. To address this, we introduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions (each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks captured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD). We propose a novel Uncertainty-calibrated Fusion Network (UFNet) that leverages this multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. UFNet employs independent task-specific networks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, followed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights dynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure patient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three sets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance evaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining non-inferior specificity. Withholding uncertain predictions further boosted the performance, achieving 88.0+-0.3%$ accuracy, 93.0+-0.2% AUROC, 79.3+-0.9% sensitivity, and 92.6+-0.3% specificity, at the expense of not being able to predict for 2.3+-0.3% data (+- denotes 95% confidence interval). Further analysis suggests that the trained model does not exhibit any detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups and is most effective for individuals aged between 50 and 80. Requiring only a webcam and microphone, our approach facilitates accessible home-based PD screening, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources."

    abstract: "We present a web-based framework to screen for Parkinson’s disease (PD) by allowing users to perform neurological tests in their homes. Our web framework guides the users to complete three tasks involving speech, facial expression, and finger movements. The task videos are analyzed to classify whether the users show signs of PD. We present the results in an easy-to-understand manner, along with personalized resources to further access to treatment and care. Our framework is accessible by any major web browser, improving global access to neurological care."

    abstract: "We introduce a framework for screening Parkinson’s disease (PD) using English pangram utterances. Our dataset includes 1,306 participants (392 with PD) from both home and clinical settings, covering diverse demographics (53.2% female). We used deep learning embeddings from Wav2Vec 2.0, WavLM, and ImageBind to capture speech dynamics indicative of PD. Our novel fusion model for PD classification aligns different speech embeddings into a cohesive feature space, outperforming baseline alternatives. In a stratified randomized split, the model achieved an AUROC of 88.9% and an accuracy of 85.7%. Statistical bias analysis showed equitable performance across sex, ethnicity, and age subgroups, with robustness across various disease durations. Detailed error analysis revealed higher misclassification rates in specific age ranges for males and females, aligning with clinical insights. External testing yielded AUROCs of 82.1% and 78.4% on two clinical datasets, and an AUROC of 77.4% on an unseen general spontaneous English speech dataset, demonstrating versatility in natural speech analysis and potential for global accessibility and health equity"

    abstract: "We present an artificial intelligence (AI) system to remotely assess the motor performance of individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). In our study, 250 global participants performed a standardized motor task involving finger-tapping in front of a webcam. To establish the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms based on the finger-tapping task, three expert neurologists independently rated the recorded videos on a scale of 0–4, following the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The inter-rater reliability was excellent, with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.88. We developed computer algorithms to obtain objective measurements that align with the MDS-UPDRS guideline and are strongly correlated with the neurologists’ ratings. Our machine learning model trained on these measures outperformed two MDS-UPDRS certified raters, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.58 points compared to the raters’ average MAE of 0.83 points. However, the model performed slightly worse than the expert neurologists (0.53 MAE). The methodology can be replicated for similar motor tasks, providing the possibility of evaluating individuals with PD and other movement disorders remotely, objectively, and in areas with limited access to neurological care."

    abstract: "We present a user-centric validation of a teleneurology platform, assessing its effectiveness in conveying screening information, facilitating user queries, and offering resources to enhance user empowerment. This validation process is implemented in the setting of Parkinson's disease (PD), in collaboration with a neurology department of a major medical center in the USA. Our intention is that with this platform, anyone globally with a webcam and microphone-equipped computer can carry out a series of speech, motor, and facial mimicry tasks. Our validation method demonstrates to users a mock PD risk assessment and provides access to relevant resources, including a chatbot driven by GPT, locations of local neurologists, and actionable and scientifically-backed PD prevention and management recommendations. We share findings from 91 participants (48 with PD, 43 without) aimed at evaluating the user experience and collecting feedback. Our framework was rated positively by 80.85% (standard deviation ± 8.92%) of the participants, and it achieved an above-average 70.42 (standard deviation ± 13.85) System-Usability-Scale (SUS) score. We also conducted a thematic analysis of open-ended feedback to further inform our future work. When given the option to ask any questions to the chatbot, participants typically asked for information about neurologists, screening results, and the community support group. We also provide a roadmap of how the knowledge generated in this paper can be generalized to screening frameworks for other diseases through designing appropriate recording environments, appropriate tasks, and tailored user-interfaces."

    abstract: "Many patients with neurological disorders, such as Ataxia, do not have easy access to neurologists, -especially those living in remote localities and developing/underdeveloped countries. Ataxia is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that surfaces as difficulty with motor control, such as walking imbalance. Previous studies have attempted automatic diagnosis of Ataxia with the help of wearable biomarkers, Kinect, and other sensors. These sensors, while accurate, do not scale efficiently well to naturalistic deployment settings. In this study, we propose a method for identifying ataxic symptoms by analyzing videos of participants walking down a hallway, captured with a standard monocular camera. In a collaboration with 11 medical sites located in 8 different states across the United States, we collected a dataset of 155 videos along with their severity rating from 89 participants (24 controls and 65 diagnosed with or are pre-manifest spinocerebellar ataxias). The participants performed the gait task of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). We develop a computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate the participants from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose coordinates to capture gait characteristics such as step width, step length, swing, stability, speed, etc. Our system is able to identify and track a patient in complex scenarios. For example, if there are multiple people present in the video or an interruption from a passerby. Our Ataxia risk-prediction model achieves 83.06% accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score. Similarly, our Ataxia severity-assessment model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our model competitively performed when evaluated on data from medical sites not used during training. Through feature importance analysis, we found that our models associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with greater Ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we are releasing the models and the body-pose coordinate dataset to the research community - the largest dataset on ataxic gait (to our knowledge). Our models could contribute to improving health access by enabling remote Ataxia assessment in non-clinical settings without requiring any sensors or special cameras. Our dataset will help the computer science community to analyze different characteristics of Ataxia and to develop better algorithms for diagnosing other movement disorders."
