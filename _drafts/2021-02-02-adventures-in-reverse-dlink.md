There are places over Portugal where fiber connections are still a mirage, and all we've got are DSL connections, more specifically Asymmetric DSL (ADSL). Through the years the ISP modem + router combo has been updated and some old have been left behind. One of those was a D-Link DVA-G3170i from 2011, which seemed a good practice target for some hardware reversing.

The DVA-G3170i ADSL2+ VoIP is an ADSL router with one 10/100BASE-T RJ45 LAN port and wirless access point IEEE 802.11g-2003. It supports wireless security with WEP, WPA, WPA2 or WPA/WPA2. Internet connectivity can be established using Dynamic IP Address, Static IP Address, PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet), PPPoA (PPP over ATM) and Bridge Mode. The device has also VoIP capabilities.

| Default IP   | Mask          |

The device itself has 7 front-panel leds which correspond to, from top to bottom: Internet status, DSL (Link/Act), VoIP, WLAN, LAN (Link/Act), Init and Power.
