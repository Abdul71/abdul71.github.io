description: "Hardware and Software Rerverse Engineering an ADSL modem + router, the D-Link DVA-G3170i (2011)"
---

There are places over Portugal where fiber connections are still a mirage, and all we've got are DSL connections, more specifically Asymmetric DSL (ADSL). Through the years the ISP modem + router combo has been updated and some old have been left behind. One of those was a D-Link DVA-G3170i from 2011, which seemed a good practice target for some hardware reversing.

The DVA-G3170i ADSL2+ VoIP is an ADSL router with one 10/100BASE-T RJ45 LAN port and wirless access point IEEE 802.11g-2003. It supports wireless security with WEP, WPA, WPA2 or WPA/WPA2. Internet connectivity can be established using Dynamic IP Address, Static IP Address, PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet), PPPoA (PPP over ATM) and Bridge Mode. The device has also VoIP capabilities.

| Default IP   | Mask          |
|--------------|---------------|
| 192.168.10.1 | 255.255.255.0 |

The device itself has 7 front-panel leds which correspond to, from top to bottom: Internet status, DSL (Link/Act), VoIP, WLAN, LAN (Link/Act), Init and Power. It also has a RESET button. This information comes from the [User Manual (PT)](http://imgs.sapo.pt/images/AJUDA2009/Manual_DVA-G3170i.pdf) which also states that the credentials to the admin interface are *admin* / *admin*.

## Visual Inspection and Hardware Overview

![PCB view](/images/dlink21/physical.jpeg)

Opening the router by removing the 2 screws under the rubber protections lets us take a better look at the PCB:

- **RTL8201CP** is a single-chip/single-port PHYceiver with an MII (Media Independent Interface)/SNI (Serial Network Interface). It implements all 10/100M Ethernet  Physical-layer functions including the Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS), Physical  Medium Attachment (PMA), Twisted Pair Physical Medium Dependent Sublayer (TP-PMD), with an auto crossover detection function, 10Base-Tx Encoder/Decoder, and Twisted Pair Media Access Unit (TPMAU). [Datasheet.](http://realtek.info/pdf/rtl8201cp.pdf)

- **Infineon PSB 50702E** InfineonÂ® DANUBEADSL2/2+ IAD-on-Chip Solution for CPE Applications is a Single-chip solution for ADSL2/2+ with integrated 2-Channel Analog CODEC for IADs and Home Gateways. It has (1) Protocol Acceleration FW for MPoA, NAT and others for CPU off-load, (2) Dual 32-bit MIPS 24KEc RISC processors @333 MHz, (3) Multi Media Card Interface (SD/MMCI), (4) USB 2.0 host/device, and (5) SPI with DMA support. [More details.](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/CPE_Brochure.pdf?fileId=db3a3043156fd5730115c6e3248c0fec)

- **NANYA NT5DS16M16CS-6K** is a DRAM Chip DDR SDRAM 256Mbit 16Mx16 2.5V 66-Pin TSOP-II. 

- **Eon Silicon Solution EN29LV640B-90TIP** (not visible in the image --- backplane): 8 Megabit (1024K x 8-bit / 512K x 16-bit), electrically erasable, read/write non-volatile flash memory, CMOS 3.0 Volt-only. 

- **PEF 4268T** SLIC-DC Subscriber Line Interface Circuit with Integrated DC/DC Converter.

It also has what seems a UART port with already soldered pins, and a lot of unpopullated spots. This goes according to the ideia that DLink produced a based PCB and then configured features accordingly to aggreements with ISPs. As an example, the SoC supports USB and SD card interfaces but no socket is present. The SoC also exposes a JTAG interface (that probabily corresponds to the pins just by the *WiFi antenna* label) but they were not explored since UART worked.

## Admin Interface

Regarding the admin interface, running on `192.168.10.1:8080`, the login is made using *basic access authentication* with the credentials stated in the user manual. From there we can access the available menus which are common to any modem+router: DSL connection, WiFi management, Firewall, Updates, Statues...

<div class="row" style="text-align:center">

    <img style="width: 70%;" src="/images/dlink21/interface2.png">
  </div>
</div>

A quick look into the interface did not reveal any significant information. A minor detail is that the credentials for everything (WiFi, DSL and so on) are rendered on the interface, so by removing the input type *password*, they become visible. This would provide an attacker direct access to these credentials once they bypassed the *basic auth*.

## Getting Access

A quick `nmap` shows that the router exposes two ports: *23* for telnet and *80* for the Web Admin interface. We also have an UART port that we can use, but it requires to find the right GND/RX/TX pins. 

Since I wanted to explore UART more than Telnet, my first approach was to understand the UART port (I know it would be wiser to start off by telnet, but why not?).

With a multimeter it was easy to find out the GND pin with a connectivity test, and the VCC with a volt check, which showed that the board runned at 3.3V. However, finding the right RX / TX required some extra work. Connecting a cheap logic analyzer to the GND/RX/TX pins, and using the [Saleae Logic 2 Alpha *software*](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/), allowed to find the right combination. You may have to adjust the capture frequency in the Saleae software for proper functioning of the device.

![Logic analyzer view](/images/dlink21/logic.png)

The only missing thing was to find the right baudrate to connect to the UART port, which can be archieved by checking the transmission time of one bit, calculate the inverse and multiply by 1 000 000. So, being the transmission time is approximattely 8.688uS: (1/8.688)*1000000 = 115101, which is close to the common baudrate of 115200. 

Connecting the USB to UART (FT232 USB UART) to the exposed pins (do not forget, RX of router to TX of the FT and TX of router to the FT RX), connecting to the device using `screen`, and connecting the device to power, and we have a UBoot loading!

`$ screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200`

We have some new information as a result of this capture: 
- 32 MB of DRAM (which checks with the NANYA NT5DS16M16CS-6K chip description)
- 8 MB of flash (which also checks against the EN29LV640B-90TIP specification)
- The processor is MIPS and runs Linux (`Image Name:   MIPS Linux-2.4.31`)
- The image is `lzma compressed`, [relevant man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lzma).
- The flash size is `8388608l` and starts at address `0xb0000000`.

By interrupting the boot by pressing any key (`Hit any key to stop autoboot:  3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 0`) we enter in the Uboot menu:


And some extra information can be collected:


## I'm Root

Leting the device boot completely while connected by UART we can click any key for the Login prompt to appear. Using the default credentials of most DLink routers, *admin* / *admin*, we can login as **root**. 

```bash
BusyBox v1.00 (2009.10.01-09:47+0000) Built-in shell (msh)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.
```

BusyBox provides a set of Linux applets to intereact with embedded Linux devices. Dumping some info using the available applets (shortened):

## What happens at boot?

To better understand what happens when the device boots in the most cleaner fashion a factory reset was made by clicking the RESET button. The `HOUSEKEEPER` process detects that the button is pressed for 5 seconds and then reboots the device.


## Wireless and WPA Key Generation

Since this is a pretty old router, the algorithm for WPA key generation is well-known and part of the [Router Keygen](http://routerkeygen.github.io) application. Implementation is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/routerkeygen/routerkeygenAndroid/blob/master/android/routerKeygen/src/main/java/org/exobel/routerkeygen/algorithms/DlinkKeygen.java). First off, it the WiFi SSID and passkey should be stored somewhere in the device. After some search in the boot log file, the following lines caught my attention:

```text
Start ALL WLAN ...
[/etc/templates/wlan.sh] start 1 ...
[/var/run/wlan_if_start1.sh] ...
Start setup WLAN interface ath0 ...
```

Looking into the `/etc/templates/wlan.sh` script we can observe several curious things: 
```sh
TEMPLATES="/etc/templates/wifi"
WLAN=`rgdb -i -g /runtime/lan/wlan/enable`
OPERATE_MODE=`rgdb -i -g /wireless/ap_mode`
#...
case "$1" in
1|start|restart)
#...
        if [ "$OPERATE_MODE" = "0" -o "$OPERATE_MODE" = "" ]; then 
                rgdb -A $TEMPLATES/wlan_if_run.php -V generate_start=1 -V wlanid=$2 > /var/run/wlan_if_start$2.sh
                rgdb -A $TEMPLATES/wlan_if_run.php -V generate_start=0 -V wlanid=$2 > /var/run/wlan_if_stop$2.sh
#...
```
First, there is an utility called `rgdb` that allows one to retrieve configuration values, e.g. the `OPERATE_MODE`. `rgdb` is an alias for the `rgbin` binary, and from [here](https://forum.kitz.co.uk/index.php?topic=10635.90): "`/usr/sbin/rgbin` appears to be the userspace utility for reading and writing the "NVRAM" area of flash. In the NVRAM area is that gzip'ed XML MIB file which contains the configuration parameters to disable LAN access and lock the device."

Looking into the PHP script `wlan_if_run.php` which is located in the folder `/etc/templates/wifi`, we can see that it checks for any changes in the system configuration (I supposed that these changes correspond to the ones made using the Web Admin GUI) and updates the system files accordingly, including the `hostapd` config file: 
`$hostapd_conf = "/var/run/hostapd".$wlanid.".conf";`. Looking for the config file in the `/var/run/` we can find it:

```text
#/var/run/hostapd1.conf

interface=ath0
bridge=br0
ssid=DLink-F0159B
wpa=1
driver=madwifi
ieee8021x=0
eapol_key_index_workaround=0
logger_syslog=0
logger_syslog_level=0
logger_stdout=0
logger_stdout_level=0
debug=0
wpa_group_rekey=3600
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_passphrase=8XYXNqrqX85XX5rN8q8Y
```

Here we can seen the SSID of the network, in this case, `DLink-F0159B` and the generated password (remember that we did a RESET): `8XYXNqrqX85XX5rN8q8Y`.
- The generation of **SSID** was obvious: the MAC address of the device is `00:22:B0:F0:15:9B` and the SSID is `DLink-` plus the last 3 pairs of hex digits without the separator: `F0159B`. 
- The generation of the **password** was a little more *fun* to discover. While this could be configured manually in the firmware of the device, this would imply extra costs for the manufacturer (each device would have to persist a unique token), thus it is not so common. More common is that the *script* that generates the passwords is stored on the device and *when the device is booted for the first time (or RESETed)* it uses some `logic` to define a unique password. This password can either be always the same for a sepecific device or not depending on the *seed* used, but, once again, the first is more common.

Further looking into the boot logs and the WLAN related scripts something pop-out with the word keygen in it (file `/etc/defnodes/S13setext.sh`): 

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo [$0] ... > /dev/console
LANMAC=`rgdb -i -g /runtime/layout/lanmac`
WLANMAC=`rgdb -i -g /runtime/layout/wlanmac`
DSL_WANIF_MAX=`rgdb -i -g /runtime/layout/dsl_wanif_max`
WLANIF_MAX=`rgdb -i -g /runtime/layout/wlanif_max`
bootcodeversion=`rgdb -i -g /runtime/sys/info/bootcodeversion`

#ADSL WANMAC
i=1
while [ "$i" -ge 1 -a "$i" -le "$DSL_WANIF_MAX" ]; do
        xmldbc -x /runtime/wanmac/wanmac$i "get:alpha_macaddr $LANMAC 0 $i"
        i=`expr $i + 1`
done

#WLAN MAC
i=1
j=0
while [ "$i" -ge 0 -a "$i" -le "$WLANIF_MAX" ]; do
    xmldbc -x /runtime/wlanmac/wlanmac$i "get:alpha_macaddr $WLANMAC 1 $j"
    i=`expr $i + 1`
        j=`expr $j + 1`
done

#bootcodeversion
bootcodeversion=`echo $bootcodeversion | tr -d  \"`
rgdb -i -s /runtime/sys/info/bootcodeversion "$bootcodeversion"

#wpa-psk keygen
xmldbc -x /runtime/wpakey "get:wpakeygen $LANMAC"
```

A new curious binary appears, the `xmldbc`, which is located in `/usr/sbin/xmldbc`. From [here](): "the `xmldbc` tool has all the commands needed to set the elements (nodes) in the XML MIB", MIB standing for management information base, which is a database used for managing the entities in a communication network. It can also run commands and set variables in the MIB with the result. So this appears to be the place where the `wpa-psk` is generated and, then, stored. The command executed is `wpakeygen $LANMAC` where the `$LANMAC` is equal to the `$WLANMAC` one.

Looking for the `wpakeygen` binary we can find it in the same folder: `/usr/sbin/wpakeygen`. Transfering the binary to my machine using the configured TFTP allows one to debug it and understand what it does to generate the key. Firing up Ghidra with it we can confirm that it is indeed a MIPS binary: 
```text
ELF 32-bit MSB executable
    MIPS
    MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV)
    dynamically linked
    interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0
    stripped
```

Looking for the main function in the function tree we can find the `wpakeygen_main` which seems a rather good candidate, so lets look at the p-code:

<center>
<img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/images/dlink21/ghidra-pcode.png"/>
</center>


The first part of the code which is hidden just defines the variables and reads the `MAC` as the argument. Then the function `Alpha_MACString_Remove_Separator` is called, and, by its name, we can conclude that it removes the MAC address separator between the pairs of hex digits. In the following lines the return of this function is stored (including repetitions), in a mostly-random way, in a *string* with 20 chars of size.

Lastly, an iteration over those 20 chars is carried, and in the last lines of the loop a resuling `index` value is used to get something (a char) from a memory position. Searching for that position we find the scalar `XrqaHNpdSYw86215U`. So the password is made of chars taken from random positions of that scalar string (of 17 chars), giving a final password of 20 chars, which meaning that bruteforcing would result in 17^20 possibilities, which equals: `4 064 231 406 647 572 522 401 601`. So, bruteforcing would take some time...

So, lets reverse the remaning p-code:

- `uVar1 = (int)local_60[i] - 0x30;` : Takes the char at pos `i` and subtracts `0x30`;
- The following `if` does a lot of things, breaking it into parts by the `&&`:
    - `(9 < (uVar1 & 0xff)` verifies that `uVar1 & 0xff` is greater than `9`;
    - `(iVar2 = (int)*(char *)(local_60[i] * 2 + __ctype_toupper + 1), uVar1 = iVar2 - 0x37, 5 < ())` also does lots of stuff using the `comma operator`. In a condition, the comma operator runs all the instructions but only evaluates the value of the rightmost one, which is `iVar2 - 0x41U & 0xff > 5`. The remaning ones:
        - `iVar2 = (int)*(char *)(local_60[i] * 2 + __ctype_toupper + 1)` converts the `local_60[i]` to uppercase;
        - `uVar1 = iVar2 - 0x37` just updates the value of `uVar1` by subtracting `0x37` to `iVar2`.

At last the resulting `wpa-psk` is printed with `printf`.

Converting all of this logic to Python gives something similar to the following:

{% highlight python linenos %}
magic_key = "XrqaHNpdSYw86215U"
mac = []
mac.extend("0022B0F0159B")
str1 = [""]*20

str1[1] = mac[0]
str1[7] = mac[3]
str1[8] = mac[7];
str1[19] = mac[10];
str1[2] = mac[10];
str1[11] = mac[5];
str1[12] = mac[1];
str1[13] = mac[6];
str1[14] = mac[8];
str1[15] = mac[9];
str1[16] = mac[11];
str1[17] = mac[2];
str1[18] = mac[4];
str1[0] = mac[11];
str1[3] = mac[1];
str1[4] = mac[9];
str1[5] = mac[2];
str1[6] = mac[8];
str1[9] = mac[4];
str1[10] = mac[6];

i=0
result=[""]*20
index = "A"
while(True):
    t = ord(str1[i]);
    if (t >= ord('0')) and (t <= ord('9')):
        index = t - ord('0');
    else:
        t = ord(chr(t).upper())
        if (t >= ord('A')) and (t <= ord('F')):
            index = t - ord('A') + 10
        else:
            print("error")
            break
    result[i] = magic_key[index]
    i=i+1
    if i > 20:
        print(result)
        break
{% endhighlight %}

## Exploring the `xmldbc` and `rgbd` binaries

Both the `xmldbc` and `rgbd` are used to interact with stored values in the system. These binaries have been used in the DLink routers for years and one funny trick with `xmldbc`is that it can be used to dump all the persistent configurations of the router:

```text
DVA-G3170i/PT # xmldbc -d /tmp/dump.xml
DVA-G3170i/PT # cat /tmp/dump.xml

<dlink_dvag3170i_pt_A1LWFg_8f32r_1S>
;remaining 2659 lines
</dlink_dvag3170i_pt_A1LWFg_8f32r_1S>

DVA-G3170i/PT # tftp -p -l /tmp/dump.xml 192.168.x.x 2121
``` 

And we now have all the router configs which include:

- the username and password of the DSL line if configured (defaults shown):

```xml
<user>as0000000@sapo</user>
<password>master_ph!</password>
```

- all of the valid user credentials for accessing the router (defaults shown):

```xml
<user id="1">
    <name>admin</name>
    <password>admin</password>
    <group>0</group>
</user>
<user id="2">
    <name>user</name>
    <password>user</password>
    <group>1</group>
</user>
```

- the crendentials and endpoint of the ISP-configured TR-069[^1] ACS server (Auto Configuration Server (ACS) enables Telcos and ISPs to manage their devices remotely):

```xml
<managementserver>
    <username>ââââââââââââââ</username>

</managementserver>
```

## Wrap Up

While this is by now a mostly-unused router, an advanced search using the [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) shows that there are 138 unique APs broadcasting an SSID with similar format (`DLink-______`) and that share the same first 3 pairs of hex digits of the MAC address (manufacturer code), `00:22:B0`, in Portugal and with last seen of Jan of 2019. Given the history of people not changing default passwords, this can still be a problem as of today.
