Radio communications always had my curiosity, but little to no focus. Recently I brought a Software-defined Radio (SDR) and started doing some experiments... and now I'm building my own antennas for receiving satellite images. These are some field notes on radio waves and others.

<!--more-->

A SDR is a _radio communication system where components that have been traditionally implemented in hardware are instead implemented by means of software_[^1]. Components such as modulators, demodulators, and tuners that are traditionally implemented in analogue hardware components, can be nowadays implemented in software by leveraging technology such as analogue to digital converters (ADC). There are several use-cases for SDR technology since they enable the changing radio protocols in real time while using the same hardware.

## Waves and Antennas

Radio waves are a subset of _electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light_[^3], which can be artificially generated by transmitters using antennas.

> Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave)).

Antennas are typically built in a way that they interact ("_create resistance_") as the waves moves across them (see animation above). There are several types of antennas, which are directly correlated to the wavelength of the signal they want to capture. The wavelenght (`λ`) of a signal is given by `λ = c / f`, where `f` is the signal frequency and `c` the speed of light (~300,000 km/sec).

The dimensions of an antenna are directly related to the `λ` of a given signal. There are many kinds of antennas, but for simplicity, consider the following examples:

  <div class="column">
    <img style="height: 150px;width: auto;" alt="monopole" src="/images/satsandradio21/monopole.png">

    <p>Quadrupole (45° between rods)</p>
  </div>
</div>

An antenna has always two poles, one positive and other negative. In some cases, such as the monopole, the negative pole is connected to ground plane (e.g., Earth). Different types of antenna are more suitable to certain wavelengths, e.g., in some cases monopoles can be as high as `λ/2`. Additionally, as the frequency increases more specific antennas are required (e.g., dish-shaped parabolic or quadrifilar helicoidal antennas). Other worth mention antennas are the [YouLoop Magnetic Antenna](https://airspy.com/youloop/) for HF frequencies, and the [MiniWhip](https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn07.html) which is an active antenna[^5] for the LF, MF and HF bands.

The used spectrum of radio waves is presented in the figure above (from [terasense](https://terasense.com/terahertz-technology/radio-frequency-bands/)). As an example, short wave communications, one of the most know and used bands across amateur radio, operates in the High frequency (HF) spectrum. There are several organizations and legislation related to the correct usage of the spectrum, including transmission power, interferences, and spectrum allocation, see more at [ANACOM](https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?categoryId=312955) (for Portugal) and [**ITU** Radio Regulations](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR-2020) (for international scope).

Signals (e.g., messages, audio,...) can be _encoded_ (i.e., modulated) in radio waves using different strategies. A summary of all the different strategies is given in the figure above, left[^4]. The most common modulations are done by changing the amplitude and/or frequency, as given in the animated GIF on the right.

## SDR Hardware 101

The one I brought was a [Nooelec NESDR SMArt v4 SDR](https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-smart-sdr.html) (~30€). This model, similarly to other popular ones, including the [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/), share the same [RTL2832U](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl2832u) chipset, which was originally developed by Realtek as a high-performance DVB-T COFDM demodulator with USB 2.0 support. Palosaari _et al._ found out that it was possible to access the raw I/Q data of these cheap DVB-T dongle, access made simple by the [custom software driver](https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr) developed by Steve Markgraf.

There are some characteristics of these low-cost SDRs that are a good insight to their functioning (using the mentioned Nooelec as a reference):

- Approx. Frequency Range: 24MHz — 1750MHz
  - Lower frequencies -- i.e., shortwaves -- can be reach using a cheap [upconverter](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-addons/ham-it-up.html);
- Rx only:
  - Reduces the capability of creating radio interferences and make other mistakes while experimenting with it;
- SMA Female antenna connector:
  - Another adapter hell (SMA/BNC/UHF/N/F/...);
- Maximum sample rate is 3.2 MS/s (mega samples per second):
  - Too low sample rates can cause problems when demodulating/decoding signals;
- ADC native resolution is 8 bits:
  - This impacts directly the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), value that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise;
  - The [theoretical SNR](htthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waveps://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/adc-input-noise.html) of a perfect **N**-bit ADC is given by 6.02 dB \* **N** + 1.76 dB;
  - This results in a ~50 dB Signal to noise ratio, [but most signals do not come closer to that value](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/e96308/comment/fagpnui/);
- ~75 Ohm input impedance[^2]:
  - Most common (standard) impedance is 50 Ohm (50 Ohm cabling on a 75 Ohm input will be less than 0.177 dB);
  - Impedance should be close among the components in a given setup (mismatch in impedance leads to voltage and current reflections);
  - For consistency’s sake, all other hardware, antennas, and such will be considered to work at 50 Ohm.

This gives an overview of the key hardware terms of the functioning of an SDR. Other hardware concepts will be introduced as needed (filters, antennas, and others).

## SDR Software 101

Since we reduce the reliance on hardware parts, we require _lots_ of software to complete the missing pieces. If you are in a Windows machine, [SDR# from Airspy](https://airspy.com/download/) is a good place to start (and brings together all the drivers and stuff you need to start playing around).

In a Linux machine start by installing the RTL-SDR drivers from your package manager or [source](https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr). After that, it is time to start to navigate in the spectrum. There are several _clients_, the next are a few ones:

- [Gqrx](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx), SDR receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit (will be used as a reference).
- [SDR++](https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus), SDR software with the aim of being bloat free and simple to use.
- [gnuradio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio), toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios.
- [SDRangel](https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel), SDR and signal analyzer frontend to various hardware.

Similarly, other software will be introduced as needed.

## Listening to 433Mhz Signals

Part of the **industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio band** (which includes 433.92 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2400 MHz) it is widely used for common appliances such as garage door openers, wireless alarm or monitoring systems, industrial remote controls, smart sensor applications, tires pressure sensors, and wireless home automation systems.

Due to its widespread use, this is one of the bands easier to receive, analyze, demodulate and decode. A simple and cheap monopole (e.g., telescopic) or dipole antenna approximately tuned to these frequencies is able to receive signals.

After connecting such antenna to the SDR, and the SDR to a Linux machine, we can start analyzing the spectrum with Gqrx.

  <div class="column">
    <img style="width: 70%;" src="/images/satsandradio21/gqrx433.png">
  </div>
</div>

We could now save the raw digital signal and analyze it manually (demodulate). There are a [few](https://gabor.heja.hu/blog/2020/03/16/receiving-and-decoding-433-mhz-radio-signals-from-wireless-devices/) [guides](https://goughlui.com/2013/12/20/rtl-sdr-433-92mhz-askook-decoding-of-various-devices-with-rtl_433/) [available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms5r9o8P6N4) [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdwwqLYr_LE) on how to do it, so I will not delve into the details.

A easier and quicker way to get it done is to use the [rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433): `rtl_433` _(despite the name) is a generic data receiver, mainly for the 433.92 MHz, 868 MHz (SRD), 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands._
